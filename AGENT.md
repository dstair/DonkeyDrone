# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Summary

DonkeyDrone adapts the DonkeyCar pipeline to fly a simulated quadrotor drone using a CNN trained from camera images. Workflow: manually fly → record data → train CNN → fly autonomously. Runs on BetaFlight SITL + Gazebo Harmonic, native Apple Silicon (ARM64).

**Semantic mapping** (identical key names to DonkeyCar, BetaFlight Angle mode):
- `steering [-1, 1]` = yaw rate
- `throttle [-1, 1]` = forward pitch (tilt angle)
- `altitude [-1, 1]` = motor throttle (direct power, no PID)

## Commands

## Python Environment

- **Python 3.12 exactly** (`requires-python = "==3.12.*"`)
- Package manager: `uv` (not pip)
- `.env` file at project root is required (sets PYTHONPATH, DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, GZ_IP)
- gz-python is NOT on PyPI — installed by `brew install gz-harmonic` into Homebrew site-packages
- No tests, no linting/formatting configuration

### BetaFlight SITL Protocol

| Port | Direction | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| 9002 | SITL → Gazebo | Motor speeds [0-1] (Gazebo plugin) |
| 9003 | Gazebo → SITL | FDM state: IMU, position, orientation |
| **9004** | **Us → SITL** | **RC channels (16x uint16, 1000-2000 μs PWM)** |
| 5761 | TCP | Configurator (setup only) |

RC packet: `struct.pack('<d', timestamp)` + 16 × `struct.pack('<H', channel)` = 40 bytes

### Key design decisions

- **gz_camera_worker runs as a subprocess** (not thread) to avoid libprotobuf version conflicts between gz-python and TensorFlow/PyTorch
- **Shared memory IPC**: parent creates POSIX SharedMemory, worker writes frames with a sequence counter, parent polls counter in `run_threaded()` for zero-copy reads
- **Direct throttle**: no altitude PID — `altitude [-1,1]` maps to motor power, matching real BetaFlight Angle mode behavior for CNN transferability
- **Config system** (DonkeyCar pattern): `dk.load_config(config_path='config.py', myconfig='drone_config_65mm.py')` (or `_85mm`) — edit the airframe-specific file, never `config.py`

## Camera Modes

Controlled by `DRONE_CAMERA_SOURCE` in your `donkeydrone/drone_config_XXmm.py`:
- `"gz_transport"` (default): native macOS, Gazebo Harmonic, gz-python bindings
- `"rtsp"`: Docker legacy mode, Gazebo Classic, OpenCV VideoCapture

## CNN Model (LinearModel)

- 5× Conv2d (stride 2 or 1, ReLU, Dropout 0.2) → Flatten → Dense(100) → Dense(50) → Linear(3) [steering, throttle, altitude]
- Input: `(B, 3, H, W)` float32 [0,1]. Fully size-agnostic (adapts to IMAGE_W/IMAGE_H)
- Training uses MPS (Apple Silicon GPU) automatically if available, then CUDA, then CPU

## Important Config Parameters (`donkeydrone/drone_config_{65,85}mm.py`)

- `DRONE_GZ_CAMERA_TOPIC`: must match world + model name — the two configs are preset for their own worlds (`drone_course_65mm` / `drone_course_85mm`)
- `GZ_WORLD` env var in `scripts/start.sh`: derived from `--airframe` (default `drone_course_65mm`); only override manually if you know what you're doing
- `BETAFLIGHT_RC_HOST`/`BETAFLIGHT_RC_PORT`: BetaFlight SITL RC endpoint (default 127.0.0.1:9004)
- `DRONE_HOVER_THROTTLE`: PWM midpoint for hover (default 1500)
- `DRONE_THROTTLE_RANGE`: altitude [-1,1] maps to ±this around hover (default 300)
- `DRONE_MAX_PITCH_ANGLE`: max pitch degrees for forward tilt (default 25.0)
- `SIMULATED_DELAY_MS`: simulated camera delay in ms (0=off)
- `MEASURE_LOOP_DELAY`: log vehicle loop timing stats
- `IMAGE_W`/`IMAGE_H`: camera resolution for CNN pipeline (default 320×240)
- `DRIVE_LOOP_HZ`: vehicle loop frequency

## Flight Tuning: Throttle, PWM, Hover

### RC channels and PWM

BetaFlight SITL is fed 16-channel RC packets over UDP 9004 at 50Hz. Each channel is a `uint16` PWM value in microseconds, range `1000`–`2000` (1500 = centered stick). Defaults follow the BetaFlight AETR rxmap:

| Channel | Meaning (Angle mode) | How it's driven |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------|
| CH1 | Roll  | held at 1500 (no lateral input in the current mapping) |
| CH2 | Pitch | `1500 + throttle × 500 × DRONE_INPUT_SENSITIVITY` — forward tilt |
| CH3 | **Motor throttle** | bipolar around hover: `clamp(HOVER_THROTTLE + altitude × THROTTLE_RANGE, 1000, 2000)` |
| CH4 | Yaw   | `1500 + steering × 500 × DRONE_INPUT_SENSITIVITY` |
| CH5 (AUX1) | Arm | 2000 armed, 1000 disarmed |
| CH6 (AUX2) | Angle mode | 2000 active |

CH3 is **bipolar**: `altitude=0` → hover PWM (drone holds altitude — sim thrust is deterministic), `altitude=+1` → `HOVER_THROTTLE + THROTTLE_RANGE` (climb), `altitude=-1` → `HOVER_THROTTLE - THROTTLE_RANGE` (descend). Arrow-key UI increments by `DRONE_THROTTLE_STEP_SIZE` per keydown and snaps altitude to 0 on keyup, giving an analog-stick feel. See `drone_gym.py:_map_controls_to_rc`.

### Hover PWM and the thrust-to-weight envelope

The hover PWM depends on: drone mass, `motorConstant` in `model.sdf`, `maxRpm`, and (secondarily) the LiftDrag plugin tuning on each rotor. At hover, total thrust must equal weight: `4 × motorConstant × ω² = m × g`.

For the current 65mm Air65-style model (total mass ≈ 0.031 kg, `maxRpm=2094`):

- `motorConstant = 7.0e-8` → hover at **PWM ≈ 1493** (50% throttle), TWR ≈ 4× — matches a real BetaFPV Air65 (65mm, ~31g AUW)
- For reference, the prior 85mm FlyWoo Flylens profile was `motorConstant = 2.8e-7` at 125g AUW (also hover ≈ 1495, same TWR)

If the drone launches at a PWM well below 1500, lower `motorConstant`. If it can't lift off at all, raise it. Since thrust ∝ motorConstant × ω² and ω scales linearly with PWM, motorConstant must scale with mass to preserve hover PWM when you change the airframe.

### Finding hover PWM: `test_thrust.py`

`./scripts/test_thrust.sh` is the fastest way to re-tune after any change to `model.sdf` or drone mass. It:
1. Brings up BetaFlight SITL + Gazebo (via `start.sh --no-manage`)
2. Arms BetaFlight with a proper **disarm → arm** sequence (BF sets a `NOT_DISARMED | ARM_SWITCH` flag on boot if it sees AUX1 HIGH before ever seeing it LOW — any test that skips the disarm phase will sit with motors at 0)
3. Ramps throttle 1000→2000 in 50 PWM steps (0.5s per step) and logs altitude at each
4. Tears everything down

Interpret the output like this: hover is the lowest PWM where altitude climbs above ~0.04m within 0.5s. Rows showing `0.010m` are "still on the ground" (the spawn altitude). A well-tuned drone should show hover near PWM 1500, with the altitude growing smoothly — not exponentially — for the next 2–3 steps.

### Why BetaFlight needs a disarm phase

BetaFlight's SITL boot state includes an "arm switch was high at boot" safety flag (`NOT_DISARMED | ARM_SWITCH` in MSP_STATUS_EX's arming disable flags). The flag clears only after BF observes AUX1 go LOW. `drone_gym.py` already does this in phase 1 of `_betaflight_loop`; any ad-hoc test or tool that sends RC packets to port 9004 must do the same or motors will stay at 0 regardless of the throttle channel.

### `DRONE_HOVER_THROTTLE` vs. `DRONE_THROTTLE_RANGE`

`DRONE_HOVER_THROTTLE` is the PWM that produces hover thrust (altitude=0). `DRONE_THROTTLE_RANGE` is the symmetric deflection around it. The result is clamped to `[1000, 2000]`. With defaults (`HOVER_THROTTLE=1500`, `THROTTLE_RANGE=300`):

- `altitude = -1.0` → PWM 1200 (descend)
- `altitude =  0.0` → PWM 1500 (hover)
- `altitude = +1.0` → PWM 1800 (climb)

The drone takes off on arm because CH3 starts at hover PWM as soon as the arm sequence (which holds CH3=1000 for 2s) completes. To land, hold Down to bring altitude toward -1. If you change the real hover PWM (e.g. by editing `motorConstant`), update `DRONE_HOVER_THROTTLE` so `altitude=0` still corresponds to hover — otherwise the CNN will learn a skewed altitude distribution.

### Planned: vertical-velocity damper (not yet implemented)

Problem: "hover PWM" means thrust = weight → zero *acceleration*. It does not zero existing vertical *velocity*. In sim (minimal air drag) a drone that was climbing and has its stick released keeps coasting upward. Users expect "release = stop in mid-air," which needs an active damper.

Design — proportional altitude-hold in `drone_gym.py`:
1. Subscribe to `/world/drone_course/dynamic_pose/info` (Pose_V) in a gz-transport thread; keep latest position and compute vz by differencing consecutive poses (or subscribe to a velocity topic if one exists). `test_thrust.py` already has the subscribe-once-keep-latest pattern — lift it into `drone_gym.py` as `_PoseTracker`.
2. In `_map_controls_to_rc`, when `abs(altitude) < hold_deadband` (e.g. 0.05), bias CH3 by `-k × vz`. `k` in PWM-per-(m/s) — start with `k = 30` (i.e. a 1 m/s climb gets countered by -30 PWM, roughly -1.4 m/s² in current physics).
3. When the user gives altitude input (stick out of deadband), bypass the damper so the climb command dominates.
4. Add config knobs: `DRONE_ALTITUDE_HOLD_K = 30`, `DRONE_ALTITUDE_HOLD_DEADBAND = 0.05`, `DRONE_ALTITUDE_HOLD_ENABLED = True`.

Why proportional only: we specifically *don't* want integral because it would fight the user's altitude commands. We also don't want target-altitude-based hold (too complex, requires latching a target when stick releases).

Validation: add `--mode=damper` to `test_thrust.py`. Steps: (a) fly to ~2m with CH3=1600 for 2s, (b) cut to CH3=hover, sample altitude for 5s at 0.25s, (c) assert `|vz| < 0.1 m/s` within 1s and altitude doesn't drift more than 0.5m over the following 4s.

Risks: oscillation if `k` is too high. Start low and tune up. The Gazebo pose topic is ~30Hz so the damper loop won't be tight — expect smooth but not snappy settling.

## Gazebo Worlds & Drone Models

Two parallel airframes share one course layout but separate world + model files. `--airframe=65mm|85mm` on `start.sh` / `test_thrust.sh` selects between them (default 65mm).

Both `worlds/drone_course_65mm.sdf` and `worlds/drone_course_85mm.sdf` include:
- Identical colored wall course (red, yellow, blue, orange) with landmark pillars
- `<include>` for the matching `betaloop_drone_cam_{65,85}mm` model (resolved via `GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH`)
- All 5 required world plugins: `Physics`, `UserCommands`, `SceneBroadcaster`, `Sensors` (ogre2), `Imu`

The 65mm model (`~/dev/aeroloop_gazebo/models/betaloop_drone_cam_65mm/model.sdf`) — BetaFPV Air65:
- 0.022kg base_link, ~0.031kg AUW, rotor positions ±0.023m (65mm wheelbase)
- `motorConstant = 7.0e-8` — hover ≈ PWM 1493, TWR ≈ 4×
- 31mm (1.2") props, 0802-class motors (vel_cmd_max=2094 rad/s)

The 85mm model (`~/dev/aeroloop_gazebo/models/betaloop_drone_cam_85mm/model.sdf`) — FlyWoo Flylens:
- 0.088kg base_link, ~0.125kg AUW, rotor positions ±0.030m (85mm wheelbase)
- `motorConstant = 2.8e-7` — hover ≈ PWM 1497, TWR ≈ 4×
- Same prop/motor class as 65mm; only mass + spacing differ

Both have forward-facing camera (640×480, 30Hz, 80° FOV), IMU on base_link (1000Hz NED-rotated), BetaflightPlugin with rotor-to-joint mapping (BF QUADX motor order), and scaled Iris mesh as a visual placeholder.

Camera topics:
- 65mm: `/world/drone_course_65mm/model/betaloop_drone_cam_65mm/link/camera_link/sensor/camera/image`
- 85mm: `/world/drone_course_85mm/model/betaloop_drone_cam_85mm/link/camera_link/sensor/camera/image`

### BetaflightPlugin Rotor Mapping

**Critical gotcha:** BF SITL's `pwmCompleteMotorUpdate()` shuffles motors before the UDP send to Gazebo:

```
pkt[0] = BF motor 1   (Front-Right, CCW)
pkt[1] = BF motor 2   (Rear-Left,   CCW)
pkt[2] = BF motor 3   (Front-Left,  CW)
pkt[3] = BF motor 0   (Rear-Right,  CW)
```

BetaflightPlugin's `<rotor id="N">` indexes the **packet slot**, not BF's internal motor number. The model's rotor layout and the `<rotor>` blocks in `model.sdf` are intentionally ordered to match the post-remap packet, so the final `rotor id → joint` mapping is 1:1:

| `<rotor id>` | Receives | Position | Direction | Joint |
|--------------|----------|----------|-----------|-------|
| 0 | BF motor 1 | Front-Right | CCW | `rotor_0_joint` |
| 1 | BF motor 2 | Rear-Left   | CCW | `rotor_1_joint` |
| 2 | BF motor 3 | Front-Left  | CW  | `rotor_2_joint` |
| 3 | BF motor 0 | Rear-Right  | CW  | `rotor_3_joint` |

Do **not** re-map `<jointName>` using a "BF motor index → joint" table. That double-applies the remap: the drone inverts thrust at arm (measured: total thrust ≈ −2.3 N, motors wildly asymmetric) and flips upside-down immediately. The source of truth is the comment block at the top of the `<plugin name="...BetaflightPlugin">` element in `model.sdf`.

## Gotchas & Troubleshooting

### Gazebo on macOS requires separate server and GUI processes
`gz sim` cannot run server + GUI in one process on macOS ([gz-sim#44](https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-sim/issues/44)). `start.sh` launches `gz sim -s` (server) then `gz sim -g` (GUI) separately. Set `GZ_HEADLESS=1` to skip the GUI.

### Stale gz-transport topics
After killing Gazebo, camera topics can persist in gz-transport's multicast discovery cache for several minutes. The readiness check in `start.sh` matches the specific `betaloop_drone_cam_{65,85}mm` topic (derived from `--airframe`) to avoid false positives from stale topics.

### World-level plugins override server.config defaults
Adding ANY `<plugin>` to the world SDF causes Gazebo to skip loading `~/.gz/sim/8/server.config` plugins (Physics, UserCommands, SceneBroadcaster). This means each `worlds/drone_course_XXmm.sdf` must explicitly include ALL five plugins: Physics, UserCommands, SceneBroadcaster, Sensors, and Imu. Without Physics, nothing moves — no gravity, no forces, no joint actuation.

### aeroloop_gazebo CMake needs Qt5 path
The BetaflightPlugin links against gz-sim8 which transitively depends on gz-gui8 (Qt5). On macOS Homebrew, Qt5 is keg-only, so CMake needs: `cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/opt/homebrew;/opt/homebrew/opt/qt@5"`

### BetaflightPlugin FDM bootstrap (deadlock fix)
The upstream BetaflightPlugin only sends FDM state after receiving motor commands, but BetaFlight SITL blocks on `recv(9003)` waiting for FDM before sending motors — a deadlock. Our fix (in `BetaflightPlugin.cc`) moves `SendState()` to run unconditionally every sim tick, before `ReceiveMotorCommand()`, so FDM flows immediately and BetaFlight unblocks. If you re-clone or update aeroloop_gazebo, this fix must be reapplied.

### BetaFlight SITL creates eeprom.bin in cwd
The SITL binary writes `eeprom.bin` (32KB BetaFlight config storage) in whatever directory it's launched from. `start.sh` runs it from the project root, so `eeprom.bin` appears there. It's gitignored. Delete it to reset BetaFlight configuration to defaults.

### Metal rendering crash (gz-sim #2877)
Gazebo camera sensors can crash with the Metal rendering backend. The world uses `ogre2` render engine explicitly. If crashes occur, try: `export GZ_SIM_RENDER_ENGINE=ogre2`

### Shared memory leak warning on shutdown
The `resource_tracker` may warn about leaked shared memory on shutdown — this is cosmetic, caused by a race between `stop_all.sh` killing processes and Python's resource tracker cleanup.

### Switching airframes
Use `--airframe=65mm|85mm` on `start.sh` and `test_thrust.sh` (default 65mm). That selects the world (`drone_course_XXmm`), model (`betaloop_drone_cam_XXmm`), and config (`drone_config_XXmm.py`) together. Each config has its own `DRONE_GZ_CAMERA_TOPIC` already matching its world + model.

## Current Status (2026-04-18)

Two airframes are maintained in parallel for A/B flight comparison: **65mm BetaFPV Air65** (~31g AUW, default) and **85mm FlyWoo Flylens** (~125g AUW). Each has its own model dir (`betaloop_drone_cam_{65,85}mm`), world SDF (`drone_course_{65,85}mm.sdf`), and config (`drone_config_{65,85}mm.py`). Motor constants are scaled so both hover near PWM 1495 with TWR ≈ 4×. Existing `eeprom.bin` retained across airframes (fresh eeprom path via start.sh is known-broken — see memory).

Known quirk: on Air65, yaw input causes significantly more climb than on the 85mm (mass is 4× smaller, mixer ω² asymmetry produces the same excess thrust → 4× more acceleration). `DRONE_YAW_PWM_CAP = 30` in both configs is the pending tuning knob.

Full stack working end-to-end: `start.sh` → Gazebo + BetaFlight SITL + drone_manage.py all launch, RC packets flow at 50Hz, camera frames arrive via shared memory, Web UI at :8887.

## Current Handoff (2026-05-09)

Goal: collect new-format drone data with no human intervention, then verify training on that new tub. The new model expects image + 6-axis IMU sequence inputs:
- `imu/acl_x`, `imu/acl_y`, `imu/acl_z`
- `imu/gyr_x`, `imu/gyr_y`, `imu/gyr_z`

Recent changes in progress:
- `donkeydrone/drone_gym.py` now subscribes to Gazebo pose + IMU telemetry and can output raw 6-axis IMU fields alongside position, attitude, and velocity.
- `DRONE_RECORD_IMU = True` was added to both `drone_config_65mm.py` and `drone_config_85mm.py`.
- `donkeydrone/drone_manage.py` records the new IMU fields into manual/autopilot tubs when `DRONE_RECORD_IMU` is enabled.
- `donkeydrone/torch_pilot.py` was updated so `.pth` inference passes an IMU history tensor to `LinearModel`; the new model no longer works with image-only inference.
- `donkeydrone/dataset.py` was updated for new-format tubs:
  - filters only `*.catalog` files, not `catalog_*.catalog_manifest`
  - skips non-sample catalog rows missing `cam/image_array`
  - resolves images from both tub root and DonkeyCar v2 `images/`
  - warns/counts records missing the six required IMU keys
- `donkeydrone/gz_camera_worker.py` unregisters the attached shared memory from the child process resource tracker; parent owns unlinking.
- `donkeydrone/autonomous_collect.py` is a headless scripted collector that directly writes a tub after confirming:
  - BetaFlight MSP is reachable on TCP 5761
  - camera frames are nonblank
  - RC/control loop has reached hover throttle after arming
  - Gazebo IMU telemetry is nonzero
- `scripts/collect_train.sh` starts `start.sh --no-manage`, runs `autonomous_collect.py`, then trains on the newly created tub.

Validated test run:
```bash
GZ_HEADLESS=1 ./scripts/start.sh --no-manage --airframe=65mm
uv run --env-file .env python donkeydrone/autonomous_collect.py \
  --airframe=65mm --duration=3 --warmup=1 --rate-hz=5 --ready-timeout=30
uv run --env-file .env python donkeydrone/torch_train.py \
  --tubs=data/tub_210_26-05-09 --model=/private/tmp/tub_210_test.pth --max-epochs=1
bash ./scripts/stop_all.sh
```

Results:
- `data/tub_210_26-05-09` was created by `autonomous_collect.py`
- 15 records were written
- catalog rows include nonzero `imu/acl_*` and `imu/gyr_*`
- one-epoch training on that tub completed successfully on MPS
- test model saved to `/private/tmp/tub_210_test.pth`

Known notes:
- `data/tub_209_26-05-09` was also created during testing and contains 50 valid records, but the first collector run exited nonzero due to a shared-memory unlink race that was then fixed in `DroneGymEnv.shutdown()`.
- `data/tub_208_26-05-09` was created during manual flight but has zero catalog records because recording stayed false.
- A cosmetic Python `resource_tracker` shared-memory warning may still appear on collector shutdown even when the process exits `0`.
- In manual web-controller runs, `AUTO_RECORD_ON_THROTTLE` may not record if only altitude/motor throttle changes and `user/throttle` stays zero; the scripted collector bypasses this by writing records directly.

Suggested next refactor:
1. Create a shared schema module, e.g. `donkeydrone/tub_schema.py`, with `DRONE_TUB_INPUTS`, `DRONE_TUB_TYPES`, and `IMU_KEYS`; use it from `drone_manage.py`, `autonomous_collect.py`, and `dataset.py`.
2. Extract Gazebo telemetry helpers (`_SimTelemetry`, `_PoseTracker`, quaternion conversion) from `drone_gym.py` into a focused module, e.g. `donkeydrone/gz_telemetry.py`.
3. Extract shared `build_drone_env(cfg, airframe=...)` construction so `drone_manage.py` and `autonomous_collect.py` do not duplicate the long `DroneGymEnv(...)` argument list.
4. Consider making autonomous flight profiles pluggable (`--profile=figure-eight`, `--profile=hover-sweep`, etc.) once the code is cleaner.

## Current Handoff (2026-05-09 evening)

Session goal was to continue the new-format drone data work, refactor it, validate real scripted collection, then start objective model evaluation.

Completed refactor work:
- Added shared tub schema module `donkeydrone/tub_schema.py` with `DRONE_TUB_INPUTS`, `DRONE_TUB_TYPES`, `IMU_KEYS`, and `drone_tub_schema(...)`.
- Added `donkeydrone/gz_telemetry.py` and moved Gazebo telemetry helpers out of `drone_gym.py`:
  - pose + IMU subscription
  - quaternion-to-Euler conversion
  - pose tracker for altitude-hold vertical velocity
- Added `donkeydrone/drone_env.py` with shared `build_drone_env(...)`.
- Updated `drone_manage.py`, `autonomous_collect.py`, and `dataset.py` to use the shared schema and env construction.
- Refactor behavior was compile checked:
  ```bash
  uv run --env-file .env python -m py_compile \
    donkeydrone/drone_gym.py donkeydrone/drone_env.py donkeydrone/gz_telemetry.py \
    donkeydrone/tub_schema.py donkeydrone/drone_manage.py \
    donkeydrone/autonomous_collect.py donkeydrone/dataset.py \
    donkeydrone/torch_train.py donkeydrone/torch_pilot.py
  ```
- `autonomous_collect.py --help` imports cleanly after refactor.
- One-epoch training smoke on `data/tub_210_26-05-09` completed and saved `/private/tmp/tub_210_refactor_smoke.pth`.

Real collection validation after refactor:
```bash
GZ_HEADLESS=1 ./scripts/start.sh --no-manage --airframe=65mm
uv run --env-file .env python donkeydrone/autonomous_collect.py \
  --airframe=65mm --duration=3 --warmup=1 --rate-hz=5 --ready-timeout=30
bash ./scripts/stop_all.sh
```

Results:
- New tub created: `data/tub_211_26-05-09`
- `15` records written.
- Catalog check: `rows=15 samples=15 missing_imu=0 nonzero_imu=15`.
- First sample had nonzero IMU values, e.g. `imu/acl_z=-9.825064663923019`.
- Sim stack was stopped afterward. `pgrep -fl 'betaflight_SITL|gz sim|ruby.*gz'` returned nothing.

Model/evaluation work:
- User created `donkeydrone/evaluate.py` from Gemini guidance. Initial file included pasted markdown after Python code and failed with:
  `SyntaxError: unterminated string literal`.
- Replaced it with a CLI evaluator that supports:
  - `--model` for single-model metrics.
  - `--old-model` + `--new-model` for comparison.
  - `--tubs`, `--image-h`, `--image-w`, `--seq-len`, `--batch-size`.
  - Metrics: per-axis MAE, RMSE, correlation, and output jitter.
- `evaluate.py` also detects old IMU-FC checkpoints (`imu_fc.*` keys) and loads them with a compatibility model. This matters because current `torch_model.py` now uses `imu_gru`, while available smoke checkpoints from earlier in the day use `imu_fc`.
- `uv run --env-file .env python -m py_compile donkeydrone/evaluate.py` passed.

Available checkpoints in `/private/tmp`:
- `/private/tmp/tub_210_test.pth` - old IMU-FC checkpoint from earlier smoke.
- `/private/tmp/tub_210_refactor_smoke.pth` - old IMU-FC checkpoint after refactor smoke.
- `/private/tmp/tub_210_gru_smoke.pth` - one-epoch checkpoint trained with current GRU-based `torch_model.py`.

Evaluation runs/results:
```bash
uv run --env-file .env python donkeydrone/evaluate.py \
  --tubs=data/tub_211_26-05-09 \
  --old-model=/private/tmp/tub_210_test.pth \
  --new-model=/private/tmp/tub_210_refactor_smoke.pth
```
- Old MAE: steering `0.0602`, throttle `0.1099`, altitude `0.0365`.
- New MAE: steering `0.0815`, throttle `0.0894`, altitude `0.0187`.
- On this tiny 15-sample held-out tub, the refactor smoke checkpoint improved throttle/altitude MAE but worsened steering MAE.

Then trained a current GRU smoke checkpoint:
```bash
uv run --env-file .env python donkeydrone/torch_train.py \
  --tubs=data/tub_210_26-05-09 \
  --model=/private/tmp/tub_210_gru_smoke.pth \
  --max-epochs=1
```
- Completed on MPS.
- Best validation loss: `0.005988`.

Compared old IMU-FC vs current GRU smoke on held-out `tub_211`:
```bash
uv run --env-file .env python donkeydrone/evaluate.py \
  --tubs=data/tub_211_26-05-09 \
  --old-model=/private/tmp/tub_210_refactor_smoke.pth \
  --new-model=/private/tmp/tub_210_gru_smoke.pth
```
- Old IMU-FC MAE: steering `0.0815`, throttle `0.0894`, altitude `0.0187`.
- New GRU MAE: steering `0.1470`, throttle `0.1105`, altitude `0.0684`.
- On this tiny held-out tub, the one-epoch GRU smoke checkpoint was worse on MAE across all three axes. Treat this as a smoke result only, not a real architecture verdict.

Current working tree at handoff:
```bash
git status --short --untracked-files=all
 M donkeydrone/smoke_test.py
 M donkeydrone/torch_model.py
 M donkeydrone/torch_train.py
?? donkeydrone/evaluate.py
```

Important caution:
- The modifications to `smoke_test.py`, `torch_model.py`, and `torch_train.py` appear to be user/new-session work. Do not revert them.
- `evaluate.py` is new and currently contains the CLI evaluator plus compatibility loader for old IMU-FC checkpoints.
- If continuing evaluation, use a larger, fixed benchmark tub; 15 records is enough only for smoke testing.

Recommended next steps:
1. Inspect the dirty changes in `torch_model.py`, `torch_train.py`, and `smoke_test.py` before editing; current `torch_model.py` uses an IMU GRU.
2. Decide whether `evaluate.py` should keep legacy IMU-FC checkpoint support or only support current GRU models.
3. Create a larger benchmark tub (or reserve one existing high-quality tub) and always evaluate new checkpoints against that same held-out data.
4. Add CLI/config support in `evaluate.py` if needed for non-320x240 configs, multiple tubs, CSV/JSON output, or aggregate score weighting by axis.
